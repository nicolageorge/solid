The Dependency Inversion Principle

<ul>
    <li>A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</li>
    <li>B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.</li>
</ul>

    <br />
    <br />

The Dependency Inversion Principle is one that leads or helps us respect all the other principles. Respecting DIP will:
</ul>
    <li>Almost force you into respecting OCP.</li>
    <li>Allow you to separate responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Make you correctly use subtyping.</li>
    <li>Offer you the opportunity to segregate your interfaces.</li>
</ul>
