<p>What we are basically talking about here is to design our modules, classes and functions in a way that when a new functionality is needed,
    <br />we should not modify our existing code but rather write new code that will be used by existing code. This sounds a little bit strange,
    <br />especially if we are working in languages like Java, C, C++ or C# where it applies not only to the source code itself but to the binary also.
    <br />We want to create new features in ways that will not require us to redeploy existing binaries, executables or DLLs.</p>
